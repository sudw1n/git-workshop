# Basic Workflow / Recap
- have a project
- turn it into a repository -> `git init`
- fundamental theorem of software engineering: "all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection"
- explain working tree, commit and index (staging area)
- stage changes to be included in next commit
- commit
--
- wanna store it elsewhere? use remotes
- remotes can be GitHub, GitLab (remote server), another directory, etc.
- push your commits to a remote
